<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<p>its a me, lumpy, welcome to my website. I'm a 20-something currently working on finishing up a degree in electrical engineering that I wish I hadn't gotten myself deep into, not sure what I'm doing after this. My favorite activies include thinking about making, perhaps even starting, things, and then not following through on them. You might know me from geometry dash, I have a minor presence in that community. I live in california and my pronouns are he/him.
<p>interests include: puzzles, internet culture, pokemon and pokemon battling, electronic music (particularly edm), siivagunner, computers, rhythm games, video games in general, geometry dash, soundodger (kinda), burritos, sinkdog, audio and music production, drawing, interesting essays, cognition & AI
<p>also da website is under construction still as you can probably tell</p>
